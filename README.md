# Data Analysis Project: Super Store Sales

## Overview
Welcome to my data analysis project focused on analyzing and visualizing sales data from the "Super Store" dataset. This project leverages the power of `Python` for data analysis and `Tableau` for interactive visualization.


## Project Highlights
Data Source: Utilized the "Super Store" dataset to extract valuable insights into sales, customer behavior, and regional trends.
Tools Used:
Python: Employed Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data cleaning, exploration, and preliminary analysis.
Tableau: Created interactive dashboards for a visually appealing and insightful presentation of the analyzed data.

## Key Steps
* **Data Cleaning and Exploration (Python) :**
  
    Identified and addressed missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
    Explored statistical summaries and distributions to understand the characteristics of the data.
* **Data Analysis (Python) :**
  
    Through comprehensive data analysis using Python, I uncovered valuable insights, revealing compelling trends, patterns, and relationships
    within the 'Super Store' dataset, offering a data-driven perspective on sales and profit , customer distribution, and regional sales.
* **Data Visualization (Tableau) :**

    Translated analysis findings into interactive and visually appealing dashboards.
    Created geographical, temporal, and categorical visualizations to highlight key insights.

* **Data Modeling (Machine Learning) :**

    By applying machine learning techniques like data preprocessing and using XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost algorithms,
    I improved the predictive accuracy of the 'Super Store' dataset. These methods allowed for a more refined understanding of the data and facilitated better decision-making.
    

* **Dashboard Highlights :**
    - Sales/Profit per [`Year`,`Month`,`Week`,`Day`]
    - Sales/Profit per `Ship Mode`
    - Sales/Profit per `Sub-Category`
    - Most Sales/Profit per `Region Among States`
    - Regional maps highlighting areas of `high and low Sales/Profit`, enabling effective geographical targeting and resource allocation
